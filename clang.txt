1.c has few keywords, a simple structure and a clearly definedsyntax.this makes it easy to catch for beginners
2.the execution time for a c code is not the fastest among all programming languages.but the speed improves as
  the quantity of the data to be processed increases astronomically
3.c provides a variety of instructions to handle the memory allocation of its resources.if something can be
  achieved using lesser resources,c has the means to achieve that
4.c's bulk libraries are very portable and cross platform compatible with UNIX,Windows,and Macintosh
5.being a high level lan its english like instructions are converted into machine-level code using a software
  program called compiler
6.c can run a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all of those

compiled language:
compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.As a result,they
tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages.
eg:c,c++,Erlang,haskell,rust,java and go
interpreted language:
interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command.
eg:python,ruby,etc

in very simple terms,the compiled programming language will never let you run the code if there is an error in
your program.
on the other hand, an interpreted programming lang just starts running the code even if there are errors in your 
program.

c is a compiled lang.
a compiler is a program that translates code written in one programming lang into another lang.
1)preprocessor: this readies the code for execution by removing any comments,replacing procedure calls with actual
  code.
2)compilation: it converts preprocessed code into assembly(low level)lang.
3)assembler:this converts assembly lang code into machine code that is a string of 1's and 0's(binary code).

c is used for:
desktop app development
game development
embedded systems
operating systems
compiler development etc.

due to its feature of memory management,c is the top choice for embedded systems development.
is deals with microcontrollers or microprocessers,say,any mechine that is controlled via inputs.C is used to create 
a logic that can control such devices.
A majority of R programming lang is written using C

we will be using the simplest way for getting this by using the GCC compiler.
GCC: GNU compiler collection


1.header files inclusion - #include <stdio.h>
there are differnt header files like
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

we will use printf() to print something in the c.
but the compiler understands this functioon only because a header file called<stdio.h> is included

2.Main function-main()
it is like heart of the code.

3.the last statement return is like an exit command for the compiler to understand that its come to an end.
4.the curly braces {} are used a lot in programming and they define a block of code

the keyword 'int' signifies an integer data type.

/* line of code */ --> used for commenting

in C we assign symbolic names,known as variables,for storing informatoin in memory.
varibles can be used to store floating-point,numbers(decimals),character,and even pointers to other locations in
memory.

variable name
assignment operator(assign the value using =)
data needed to be stored

c is statically typed lang.

defining a variable:
int age = 23;
here we have int data type declaring the variable age as an integer,
semicolons will appear to signify a single line of action.

to print age of that respective variable

int age=23;
printf("%d",age);

rules that you must follow while declaring a variable
1)a variable name should be meaningful and descriptive.
2)a variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
3)name cant start with numbers.
4) a variable should only contain alphabets,numerics and underscrores.
5)variables in c are case sensitive.

data types are the classifications or categorization of data items.

there are different types of data types
1)char- holds textual data in simpler words it contains of words.
2)int- stores integer numbers. 
3)float-stores decimal numbers.
4)double-stores more numbers than int and even shows decimal points.

an int data type can hold 32 bits of data => 2^32-1=4294967285 is the largest value that this data type
can hold.

signed and unsigned:
if signed is used with a data type , then half of its limit is used for negitive numbers and other half for 
postive numbers.

use commas to separate multiple variables on a single line and a ; at the end.

% symbol within a printf()function informs the compiler to print some value that is defined later within the function
,"d" is used for decimal numbers

float-%f
double-%lf

%.3f --> the digit here specifies the number of places to be shown after the decimal point

char single='c';
//%c is used 
printf("the single char is: %c",single);

<stdbool.h> is used for boolean.

Math in c:
5+3=8 here 5 & 3 are operands and + is operator
different types of operators:
1)arithmatic operators
2)relational operators
3)logical operators
4)bitwise operators

%is used for remainder

comparison operators:
>greater than: true if left operand is greater than the right
<less than:true if left operand is less than the right
==equal to
!= not equal to
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
